## Projects

### PLUM CUSTOMER SUCCESS TEAM EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

### MERCARI PRICE SUGGESTION ANALYSIS

- **Description:** In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting product prices for Mercari, Japan’s leading community-powered shopping app. With the vast array of products listed on Mercari's marketplace, accurately determining prices is essential. Leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML), I aimed to develop an algorithm that suggests appropriate prices based on user-provided text descriptions, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.

### REVENUE INSIGHTS ON HOSPITALITY DOMAIN DATA

- **Description:** AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/zaXai558/PowerBI_Hospitality.git

### API ON DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK

- **Description:** This API is built using Django Rest Framework (DRF) with Python. It provides endpoints to perform various operations related to product catalog. The API follows RESTful principles and returns data in JSON format.
